                            Mount Kinabalu is not only the iconic landmark of Sabah, but also a symbol of culture,
                            history,
                            and unmatched natural beauty. As one of the tallest mountains in Southeast Asia, it is more
                            than
                            just a tourist destination — it is a place rich with legends and local beliefs. In this
                            article, we will
                            explore the myths, historical background, and cultural significance of this majestic
                            mountain in Sabah.<br><br>

                            The name “Kinabalu” is believed to come from the Dusun language — combining “Aki” meaning
                            ancestor or spirit,
                            and “Nabalu” meaning mountain. Therefore, “Akinabalu” can be interpreted as the Mountain of
                            the Spirits of
                            the Ancestors. This reflects the local belief that Mount Kinabalu is a resting place for the
                            souls of the
                            departed.<br><br>

                        <h4>
                            One of the most well-known legends tells the story of a Chinese princess who waited
                            faithfully for her lover,
                            a local warrior, to return from a sea voyage. Unfortunately, he never came back. The
                            princess waited atop the
                            mountain until her death, and her spirit is said to still dwell on the mountain. This
                            romantic and tragic
                            tale adds a mystical element to Mount Kinabalu.

                            For the Kadazan-Dusun people, Mount Kinabalu is considered sacred. Every year, before major
                            climbing expeditions,
                            a ritual known as monolob is performed by a bobolian (a traditional priest or shaman). This
                            ceremony involves the
                            sacrifice of a chicken and prayers in an ancient dialect, seeking permission and protection
                            from the mountain spirits.

                        <h4>
                            Mount Kinabalu was first documented in modern history by Hugh Low, a British administrator
                            who
                            climbed the mountain in 1851. The summit route he took is now known as “Low’s Peak” in his
                            honor.
                            Since then, the mountain has attracted climbers, adventurers, and researchers from around
                            the world.

                            Mount Kinabalu is now part of Kinabalu National Park, which was declared a UNESCO World
                            Heritage Site
                            in 2000. It is home to more than 5,000 species of plants, including the world’s largest
                            flower — the Rafflesia.
                            The mountain also plays a major role in Sabah’s economy through eco-tourism and biological
                            research.

                            Mount Kinabalu is more than just a towering peak — it is a symbol of Sabah’s rich cultural
                            heritage and
                            spiritual beliefs. From mythical tales of undying love to sacred rituals passed down through
                            generations,
                            the mountain holds countless stories that connect people, nature, and the unseen world. It
                            remains a place of
                            adventure, respect, and deep reflection.
